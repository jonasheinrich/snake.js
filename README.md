# Snake.js

Just a simple snake in a browser.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys to navigate and start the game. The space bar can be
used for pause/continue. Restart the game with the 'Restart'-button or
(when the game is lost) with hitting enter.

You can increase (decrease) the speed with + (-).

## TODOs

- Score.
- Some refactorings
- Sometimes a star gets drawn on the body. Maybe because it is drawn in
  between the moving of two bodyparts.
- Endless possibilities: special items to collect, a wall that works as
  a portal (you enter an the top and get back at the bottom), obstacles
in the way, speed shifts, 2 player(!)
