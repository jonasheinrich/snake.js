# Snake.js

Just a simple snake in a browser.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys to navigate and start the game. The space bar can be
used for pause/continue. Restart the game with the 'Restart'-button or
(when the game is lost) with hitting enter.

Changing the size of the playing field or of the block size (the snake's
head) or resizing the windows leads to a restart of the game.

You can increase (decrease) the speed during the game with + (-).

## TODOs

- Some refactorings
- Endless possibilities: special items to collect, a wall that works as
  a portal (you enter an the top and get back at the bottom), obstacles
in the way, 2 player(!)
